talked with Linda and she says that since I am using VSC I do not need a python server just change
the port to 5500 , but make sure that I change it before turning it in 

`static get DATABASE_URL() {
   const port = 5500 // Change this to your server port
   return `http://localhost:${port}/data/restaurants.json`;
 }`
